CAMERA FINDER - HOW TO BUILD PORTABLE EXE
================================================================================

This guide explains how to create a single portable .exe file that your friend
can use without installing Python or any dependencies.

================================================================================
WHAT'S IMPROVED IN THIS BUILD METHOD?
================================================================================

✅ Better dependency detection - automatically finds all ONVIF WSDL files
✅ Proper bundling of ffprobe.exe - included in the executable
✅ Complete hidden imports - all Python modules properly included
✅ Single file output - just one .exe to share
✅ Better error handling - clear error messages if something goes wrong
✅ Cleaner build process - easier to use and understand

================================================================================
QUICK START - BUILD THE EXE
================================================================================

METHOD 1: Using the Batch File (Easiest)
-----------------------------------------
1. Double-click: BUILD_PORTABLE.bat
2. Wait 2-5 minutes for the build to complete
3. Done! Find your exe: CameraFinder_Portable.exe

METHOD 2: Using Python Command
-------------------------------
1. Open Command Prompt in this folder
2. Run: python build_portable_exe.py
3. Wait for build to complete
4. Done! Find your exe: CameraFinder_Portable.exe

================================================================================
REQUIREMENTS BEFORE BUILDING
================================================================================

Make sure you have:
1. Python 3.7 or higher installed
2. All packages installed: pip install -r requirements.txt
3. ffprobe.exe in this folder (already present)
4. camera_gui_fixed.py (already present)

================================================================================
WHAT HAPPENS WHEN YOUR FRIEND RUNS THE EXE?
================================================================================

1. They double-click CameraFinder_Portable.exe
2. A window opens with the Camera Finder interface
3. They click "Scan for WiFi Cameras" or "Quick IP Scan"
4. A popup appears asking for:
   - Username (default: admin)
   - Password (their camera password)
5. The app scans the network for cameras
6. Working RTSP URLs are displayed
7. They can copy the URLs to use in VLC or other players

================================================================================
TESTING THE BUILD
================================================================================

After building, test on YOUR computer first:
1. Double-click CameraFinder_Portable.exe
2. Enter camera credentials when prompted
3. Click scan button
4. Verify it finds cameras and shows RTSP URLs

If it works on your computer, it will work on theirs!

================================================================================
FILE SIZE AND REQUIREMENTS
================================================================================

Expected exe size: 40-80 MB (single file, everything included)
Target computer needs: Windows 7/8/10/11 (64-bit)
NO Python, NO packages, NO installation required!

================================================================================
WHAT'S INCLUDED IN THE EXE?
================================================================================

✅ Python interpreter
✅ All Python packages (onvif-zeep, wsdiscovery, tkinter, etc.)
✅ ffprobe.exe for stream testing
✅ ONVIF WSDL files for camera communication
✅ All dependencies

================================================================================
TROUBLESHOOTING
================================================================================

Build fails with "PyInstaller not found":
→ Run: pip install pyinstaller

Build fails with "Module not found":
→ Run: pip install -r requirements.txt
→ Then try building again

Exe doesn't work on another computer:
→ Make sure they have Windows 7 or higher
→ Try running as Administrator
→ Check Windows Defender isn't blocking it

Exe is too large:
→ This is normal! All dependencies are included
→ Size is usually 40-80 MB

================================================================================
FILES CREATED BY THIS BUILD PROCESS
================================================================================

New files created:
• CameraFinder_Improved.spec - PyInstaller configuration
• build_portable_exe.py - Build script
• BUILD_PORTABLE.bat - Easy build launcher
• HOW_TO_BUILD.txt - This file

Build output:
• dist/CameraFinder_Portable.exe - Your portable executable
• CameraFinder_Portable.exe - Copy in root folder (easy to find)
• build/ - Temporary build files (can be deleted)

================================================================================
SHARING WITH YOUR FRIEND
================================================================================

1. Find the file: CameraFinder_Portable.exe
2. Share it via:
   - USB drive
   - Email (if < 25MB, otherwise use Google Drive/Dropbox)
   - Cloud storage (Google Drive, Dropbox, OneDrive)
   - Network share
3. Tell them to:
   - Download/copy the file
   - Double-click to run
   - Enter camera username and password when prompted
   - Click scan

That's it! No installation, no setup, just run!

================================================================================
TECHNICAL DETAILS (for advanced users)
================================================================================

Build method: PyInstaller with custom spec file
Bundle mode: One-file (--onefile)
Compression: UPX enabled
Console: Disabled (GUI mode)

Key improvements over old build:
• Uses collect_all() for automatic dependency collection
• Properly bundles ONVIF WSDL files
• Includes all zeep and wsdiscovery modules
• Better hidden imports detection
• Cleaner spec file structure

================================================================================
NEED HELP?
================================================================================

Common issues and solutions:

Issue: "ffprobe.exe not found"
Solution: Make sure ffprobe.exe is in the same folder before building

Issue: "ONVIF WSDL files missing"
Solution: Reinstall onvif-zeep: pip install --upgrade onvif-zeep

Issue: Build succeeds but exe doesn't work
Solution: Try building with console=True in the spec file to see errors

Issue: Exe is flagged by antivirus
Solution: This is normal for PyInstaller exes. Create exception or sign the exe.

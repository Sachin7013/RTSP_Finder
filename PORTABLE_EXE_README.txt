CAMERA FINDER - TRUE PORTABLE EXE SOLUTION
========================================================

WHAT YOU GET:
-------------
✓ ONE single .exe file (CameraFinder_Portable.exe)
✓ NO installation required
✓ NO Python needed on target computer
✓ NO dependencies to install
✓ Works on ANY Windows 7/8/10/11 computer
✓ Just double-click to run!

HOW TO BUILD:
------------
1. Double-click: BUILD_SINGLE_EXE.bat
2. Wait 2-3 minutes
3. Get: CameraFinder_Portable.exe

HOW TO USE THE EXE:
------------------
1. Copy CameraFinder_Portable.exe to any Windows PC
2. Double-click it
3. Click "Scan for WiFi Cameras" 
4. Enter camera username/password
5. Get RTSP URLs

WHAT'S INCLUDED IN THE EXE:
---------------------------
• Python runtime (embedded)
• All required libraries (wsdiscovery, onvif, etc.)
• ffprobe.exe (for stream testing)
• GUI application code
• Everything needed to run!

WHY THE WARNING DISAPPEARED:
----------------------------
The fixed version (camera_gui_fixed.py):
• Suppresses the probe handler warning
• Has fallback methods if WS-Discovery fails
• Includes IP scanning as alternative
• Works properly when compiled to exe

TWO SCAN METHODS:
----------------
1. "Scan for WiFi Cameras" - Uses ONVIF/WS-Discovery
2. "Quick IP Scan" - Direct IP/port scanning

If one method fails, try the other!

FILE SIZE:
---------
The single exe will be ~30-50 MB because it includes:
- Python interpreter
- All libraries
- ffprobe tool
This is normal and expected for a portable exe.

DISTRIBUTION:
------------
You can share this single .exe file with anyone.
They don't need to install anything!

TROUBLESHOOTING:
---------------
• Windows Defender may scan it first (normal)
• Some antivirus may flag PyInstaller exes
• If cameras not found, try both scan methods
• Ensure on same network as cameras
